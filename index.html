                Hello, my name is Alex. I’m a web developer and designer.

            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                I’m a web developer, located in the DC Metro area.  I am currently completing a Web Development Track at Bloc.
                My goal is to become a well balanced full stack developer.
                <br>
                I enjoy trying out new skills and finding new ways of adding a creative spin on all my projects.
                I love to cook, and just like in cooking the better you understand your tools and ingredients, the better you can make any recipe your own.
                I believe this applies to everything I build as well, so I continue to find ways to test myself and expand my abilities further.

                <p>
                    My first from scratch responsive web app.
                    A quiz game, used to test javascript and jquery skills.
                    This quiz game, by user control will run through a set quiz questions one at a time.
                    It will provide feedback to the user’s input while keeping track of the question number and score, the score will be graded at the end based on the answers submitted, and then allow the user to restart the quiz upon completion.
