                Hello, my name is <span class="underline-green">Alex</span>.

                        I live and work in the Washington D.C. Metro area, where I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Maryland.  In the years since I have worked a variety of finance jobs.  Looking for an opportunity to transition into a career in a more inventive industry, I enrolled in a Web Development Bootcamp at Bloc.

                        Staying up all night working through a problem and finding a solution of my own is something I relish, but I have always excelled when working with teammates. I believe some of my greatest learning experiences have come from being instructed by or instructing other colleagues. My goal is to blend these past experiences with the new ones I’ll gain working with other skilled programmers, to ultimately become a well balanced full stack developer.

                        I enjoy trying out new skills and finding new ways of adding a creative spin on all my projects. I  love to cook, and just like in cooking the better you understand your tools and ingredients, the better you can make any recipe your own. I believe this applies to everything I build as well, so I continue to find ways to test myself and expand my abilities further.

                        When I’m not working on a project or in the kitchen, you may find me playing soccer or hanging out friends at a local brewery.  Most likely you will find me near whichever TV is playing a Ravens, Orioles or Terps game.

                        A quiz game, used to test <span class="highlight-green">javascript</span> and <span class="highlight-green">jquery</span> skills.
                        This quiz game, by user control, will run through a set quiz questions one at a time.
                        It will provide feedback to the user’s input while keeping track of the question number and score. The score will be graded at the end and then allow the user to restart the quiz upon completion.

                        This app allows users to compare the ratings of two movies based on their Internet Movie Database (IMDb), Rotten Tomatoes, and Metacritic Scores.
                        The app makes use of both The Movie Database (TMDb) API and the Open Movie Database (OMDb) API.
                        The purpose of this app was a practice in using an <span class="highlight-green">API</span> and munipulating <span class="highlight-green">JSON</span> objects into the apps' DOM.

                        This app allows users to search a database of beers and then save reviews for beers they have tried.
                        For full access a user is required to sign up and log in. Authenticated users are able to store and update data their on the server.
                        Build upon some of the fundamentals of my other projects, this project is enhanced by the use of
